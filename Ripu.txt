Maven a Built Tool
Maven is a Project Management Tool
Maven can be accessed using 2 ways
1. Maven s/w installed locally
	- Use command prompt to communicate with Maven.
	- you will be responsible to manage everything realted to Maven
Install maven

2. Maven s/w embedded in a IDE or any other s/w
	- Use GUI to communicate with Maven.
	- the IDE/S/w will be responsible.
Maven Project
- select the type of project
	a. maven-archetype-simple	=> quickstart project
	b. maven-archetype-webapp	=> web application project
	c. etc.......
- package name	= GroupID
- project name	= ArtifactID
Maven -> executes all its phases and a jar file is created
These jar file is converted into a container with JRE added into it.
These container will be deployed in the Mule run time.
[Backend - Mule run time is actually hosted inside the Anypoint Studio, By using
your own system resources the project will be executed. In short i can say that
you system will act as a server]
